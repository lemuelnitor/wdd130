        <p>
            My name is Lemuel Nitor and I am a Software Developer for an ecomerce company in the United States.
            I live with my wife and my two kids here in our ward in Bulacan, Philippines.

        <p>
            I enrolled in BYU Idaho online to better improve my skills as a Software Developer. I know that
            even if I already have an experience in this industry, I still have something new to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm looking forward to working with you all in this course!
